# message-bot
This project is meant to enable mass sending of reminder messages for events put on by any club. It is still a work in progress, hence the large amount of
hardcoded values still in the file. It takes data regarding scheduling and process it into a dictionary, which the sms function will be able to process 
and send to the provided list of recipients.
